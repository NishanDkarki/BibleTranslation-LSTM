# BibleTranslation-LSTM
This is a project with the objective to generate language translation across multiple languages.

ABSTRACT
Neural Machine Translation has varieties of applications in various domains and there has been a lot of
research performed on this field. In the paper, we propose a multi-lingual model that will be able to
translate from any source language to any target language, even though the model has not been trained on
the language pair before (zero-shot translation). For the model, we used a simple RNN architecture and
implemented a global attention layer. For training, we used Opus-100 datasets for the model.
For simplicity, we trained our model with five pair of language sets and evaluated the results.
